Directory contains clientUDP.c and serverUDP.c files that together make UDP connection,
with client sending strings of numbers, and server returning back the sum of those numbers.
The functions.c and functions.h files contain files necessary to operate on given strings.
Client may only sends string containing numbers, spaces and CR+LF symbols.
Both server and client may operate on various port, yet only provided IPv4 address is localhost
(127.0.0.1).
This task is an introduction for network programming using sockets.

To run these programs you need only to have installed C compiller.

Suggested compilation:
gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -o client clientUDP.c functions.c
gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -o server serverUDP.c functions.c

Running:
./server [port number]

./client 127.0.0.1 [port number]
